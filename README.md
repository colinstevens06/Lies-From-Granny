# Lies-From-Granny
Lies From Granny is a cover band based out of Baltimore. We're available to play at your bar, block party, wedding - really anything where you want a rockin' band.

## 4/25/20 Update
I originally designed this using just HTML, CSS and a touch of JS.

Over the past week, I refactored all my code so it uses ReactJS and SASS.

I find this new version of the codebase is more organized, uses less code, and takes advantage of components.

## Design
I wanted to create a simple, smooth design that made strong use of images. The landing page's hero image was a photo I setup right before a set at Sandlot. I used a remote flash and a tripod. My buddy just pressed the button after I got in the frame.

The three-pack is a design element I see on so many websites. Seemed like a natural spot to use for us.

I took the photo of the setlist after a gig one night. And I created the grandma logo from an EPS file that I purchased, altering the face so it was more angry and the colors for our scheme.

I also love the fade-in and fade-out of the sections via JS.

Another thing I'm doing w JS: changing which images appear depending on the screen size. Mobile and desktop users will get different hero images on the home and songs pages, and for the shows page mobile doesn't get a hero image while it does on desktop. 

## Technology Used
I used:
* Bootstrap for CSS
* JQuery w my JS
* Lots of custom CSS
* Custom navigation

## Publishing
I took this live via GoDaddy and hooked it up to Google Analytics and Search Console.
